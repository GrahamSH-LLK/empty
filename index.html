<pre>
I have hidden an item in BDL. Want to find it? Find a purple sign at your gate.

Start with "Let's have a SAFE" 
Hint: spaces and punctuation count.


50, 32, 79, 2, 55, 6, 55, 2, 79, 6, 5, 43, 44, 32, 6, 5, 8, 35, 5, 6, 32, 2, 2, 79, 6, 7, 2, 1, 63

Side with only one :)
Good luck, have fun!
